## Generating datasets with Chatito

The way Chatito works is that it expects the number of training and testing examples for a dataset to both be higher than 0. Because we have separate scripts for training and testing, we must be careful when generating the data so that the examples generated by the train script do not mix with those generated by the test script.

### Steps for generating data:
These steps apply to all scenarios except the baseline (S0 - in this case we only have one script, because both train and test sets are generated from the same vocabulary)

1. Load all train scripts (one for each intent) into Chatito. There should be 1 example set for the test set in each script.
2. Generate datasets in Rasa NLU format.
3. Two JSON files will be generated: `training_dataset` and `testing_dataset`.
4. **Keep** `training_dataset` as the training data for that scenario. `Testing_dataset` can be **thrown away**.
5. **Remove all scripts from Chatito**. This step is very important to ensure that the examples from the train and test vocabulary don't mix.
6. Load all test scripts (one for each intent). There should be 1 example set for the train set in each script.
7. Generate datasets in Rasa NLU format.
8. Just as before, two JSON files will be generated.
9. This time keep `testing_dataset` as the test data for the scenario. Throw away `training_dataset`.
