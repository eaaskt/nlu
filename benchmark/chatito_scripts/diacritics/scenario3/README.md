### Scenario 3 generation strategy

We vary the train/test quantities directly at generation, so that we obtain the 3 subscenarios:
* 3.1 -> light underrepresented
* 3.2 -> temp underrepresented
* 3.3 -> media underrepresented

The scenario 3 scripts are the same from scenario 2 + those for the intents missing from scenario 2
